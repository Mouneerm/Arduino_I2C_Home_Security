### User Manual:

● The alarm can be switched on and off by entering the 4-digits user password using the
keypad.

● Every time a digit is entered successfully, a “*” will appear as shown in figure 1:

● When the four digits have been entered, press “*”. Depending on the initial state of the
alarm, the latter will be turned on or off.

● To change the password, “C” must be pressed after entering the 4 digits.

● If the alarm is on, the red led will light up and will light off if alarm is off.

● In case the password is wronged, 2 more attempts will be given to you as shown in fig 2.

● To clear the screen, press “#” from the keypad.

● If no more attempt is left, the alarm will be activated and so the buzzer for 30 minutes.
An additional attempt will then be given.

● In the case of an intruder detected, the password is required to deactivate the alarm. The
LCD screen will display some information as shown in fig3:

● Again, press “#” to clear the display.

● When the user switches on the alarm, the LCD screen will show some information in case
the user has forgotten to close windows or doors as shown in fig4.
